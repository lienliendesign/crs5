Lien envisioned a swingset that could accommodate adults without the usual discomfort. To achieve this, she reimagined the design by making the seat large and ergonomically shaped, ensuring that even extended swinging sessions wouldn't leave sore bottoms. For the construction material, she opted for cherry wood, which she carefully thinned to the point of maximum comfort without compromising strength. The swingset, supported by dynamic climbing ropes, created a sensation of weightlessness, significantly enhancing the swinging experience. Lien's unique approach exemplified the fusion of design ingenuity and a commitment to ensuring adults could relive the pure joy of swinging without any discomfort or limitations.
